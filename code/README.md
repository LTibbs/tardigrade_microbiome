Use the `tardigrade_microbiome_processing_clean.R` script to process the mothur output (found in `taxonomy` folder). The `config.toml` file is used partway through the R file.

The `beta_processing.R` script was not used in the published analysis but shows how to calculate Beta diversity measures from divnet-rs results and so may be useful to others.
